        <h2> BUNAC </h2>
        <p>

            BUNAC provides work visas for American students to work in the UK.

            Shortly after completing my undergraduate degree, I enrolled in the program and travled to the UK, otherwise
            known as a GAP year for some.

        <h4> Nottingham </h4>
        <p> 
            <h2><a id="testP">HTML ME SOMETHING : Launch Code Assignment #4</a></h2>
            I spent Christmas in Nottingham with a family that was orignally from Nottingham but was stationed
            in
            Norfolk, VA; my hometown. I was exposed to a traditional English Christmas.

        <h4> Paris </h4>
        
           <p class="funParagraph">
            Two of my friends from High school traveled to London and we took the Eurostar to Paris. We spent 3
            days in the city and traveled to must see sites such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. We ate our
            weight in baguettes and crepes!

        <h4> Corfu </h4>
        <p>
            My roommates and I traveled to Greece after our work visas expired. This was our last trip together
            before returning to the US. We spent most of our days on the beach and shopping.
