<h2> Travels Abroad </h2>

    <h2> BUNAC </h2>
    <p>

        BUNAC provides work visas for American students to work in the UK.

        Shortly after completing my undergraduate degree, I enrolled in the program and travled to the UK, otherwise
        known as a GAP year for some.

    <h4> Nottingham </h4>
    <p>
        I spent Christmas in Nottingham with a family that was orignally from Nottingham but was stationed
        in
        Norfolk, VA; my hometown. I was exposed to a traditional English Christmas.

    <h4> Paris </h4>
    <p>
        Two of my friends from High school traveled to London and we took the Eurostar to Paris. We spent 3
        days in the city and traveled to must see sites such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. We ate our
        weight in baguettes and crepes!

    <h4> Corfu </h4>
    <p>
        My roommates and I traveled to Greece after our work visas expired. This was our last trip together
        before returning to the US. We spent most of our days on the beach and shopping.
