      <h2> Travels Abroad </h2>
      <testp>
         Shortly after completing my undergraduate degree, I traveled to the UK. BUNAC provides work visas for
         American
         students to work in the UK. While working in London I met coworkers and other BUNAC attendees. I have listed
         a
         few of the places I traveled to.

         }

         <li>
            <h3><em> Nottingham, England</h3></em>

            <p>
               I spent Christmas in Nottingham with a family that was orignally from Nottingham but was stationed
               in
               Norfolk, VA; my hometown. The family met my parents at a parade and my mother shared with them that
               I
               was in London and would not be home for Christmas. They insisted I travel to their home in
               Nottingham
               to have a traditional English Christmas.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <h3><em>Paris, France</h3> </em>
            <p>
               Two of my friends from High school traveled to London and we took the Eurostar to Paris. We spent 3
               days in the city and traveled to must see sites such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. We ate our
               weight in baguettes and crepes!

            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <h3><em>Prague, Czech Republic </h3> </em>
         </li>
         <p>
            I travled with a group of friends from London to Prague. We visited a few night clubs and drank
            absinthe
            - do not recommend! We toured the Prague Castle, Charles Bridge and the Astronomical Clock.
         </p>

         <li>
            <h3><em>Corfu, Greece </h3></em>
         </li>
         <p>
            My roommates and I traveled to Greece after our work visas expired. This was our last trip together
            before returning to the US. We spent most of our days on the beach and shopping.
         </p>
