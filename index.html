      <h2> Travels Abroad </h2> 
<p> 
   Shortly after completing my undergraduate degree, I traveled to the UK.  BUNAC provides work visas for American students to work in the UK.  While working in London I met coworkers and other BUNAC attendees.  I have listed a few of the places I traveled to.

   <li>
      <h3>Nottingham, England</h3>
   
      <p>
         I spent Christmas in Nottingham with a family that was orignally from Nottingham but was stationed in Norfolk, VA; my hometown.  The family met my parents at a parade and my mother shared with them that I was in London and would not be home for Christmas.  They insisted I travel to their home in Nottingham to have a traditional English Christmas.

   <li>
      <h3>Paris, France</h3>
      <p>
Two of my friends from High school traveled to London and we took the Eurostar to Paris.  We spent 3 days in the city and traveled to must see sites such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.  We ate our weight in baguettes and crepes!

      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3> Prague, Czech Republic </h3>
   </li>
   <p>
      I travled with a group of friends from London to Prague.  We visited a few night clubs and drank absinthe - do not recommend!  We toured the Prague Castle, Charles Bridge and the Astronomical Clock.
   </p>
   
   <li>
      <h3> Corfu, Greece </h3>
   </li>
<p> 
   My roommates and I traveled to Greece after our work visas expired.  This was our last trip together before returning to the US.  We spent most of our days on the beach and shopping.

</ul>
